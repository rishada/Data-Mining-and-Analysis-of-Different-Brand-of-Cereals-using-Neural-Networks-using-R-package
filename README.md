# Data-Mining-and-Analysis-of-Different-Brand-of-Cereals-using-Neural-Networks-using-R-package
This is a research project. In this project a data set of various cereal brands is considered for applying the Neural network and Data Science concepts and the goal is to predict the ratings of cereals with the help of the variables like fat, protein and calories. For this implementation, a neural network model will be used for training the subset of cereals. Neural network concepts used in Artificial intelligence used for training the huge volumes of data set for better and accurate data mining and analysis.
